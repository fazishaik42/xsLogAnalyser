# xsLogAnalyser
Analyze the Maximo log file and extract relevant information.
<h2>Breakdown</h2>
<p><b>Analyze:</b>Examine the log file for patterns, errors, and critical events.<br>
<b>Maximo log file:</b> The specific log file containing Maximo system logs.<br>
<b>Extract relevant information:</b> Identify and isolate key details such as timestamps, error messages, component names, and user actions.<br></p>

<h2>Additional Considerations</h2>

<p><b>Filtering:</b>If the log file is large, consider using filtering techniques (e.g., regular expressions, search terms) to narrow down the analysis to specific areas of interest.<br>
<b>Contextualization:</b> Relate the extracted information to the overall system's behavior and performance.<br>
<b>Visualization:</b> Consider using visualization tools to represent the data in a more understandable format (e.g., graphs, charts).</p>

<h2>This tool will analyse the log and breaksown the errors and create a pattern that can track down the bugs/defects.</h2>
