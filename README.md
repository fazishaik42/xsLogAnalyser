# Maximo LogAnalyser
# Analyze the Maximo log file and perform comprehensive error analysis with the help AI.
<p><h2>Leverage AI-powered log analysis to comprehensively diagnose Maximo errors.</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI-powered log analysis - Utilize artificial intelligence techniques to analyze log files.</li>
<li> Comprehensive error analysis - Conduct a thorough examination of errors, including identification, categorization, and root cause analysis.</li>
<li>Maximo - Specifically target Maximo system logs.</li> </ul>
<h2>Breakdown</h2>
<p><b>Analyze</b> - Examine the log file for patterns, errors, and critical events.<br>
<b>Maximo log file</b> - The specific log file containing Maximo system logs.<br>
<b>Extract relevant information</b> - Identify and isolate key details such as timestamps, error messages, component names, and user actions.<br></p>
<h2>Additional Considerations</h2></p>

<p><b>Filtering</b> - If the log file is large, consider using filtering techniques (e.g., regular expressions, search terms) to narrow down the analysis to specific areas of interest.<br>
<b>Contextualization</b> - Relate the extracted information to the overall system's behavior and performance.<br>
<b>Visualization</b> - Consider using visualization tools to represent the data in a more understandable format (e.g., graphs, charts).</p>

<h2>Python-based log analysis tool capable of categorizing and isolating errors.</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Log analysis - It can process and examine log files.</li>
    <li>Categorizing errors - It can classify errors based on predefined criteria or patterns.</li>
    <li>Isolating errors - It can identify and extract specific error instances from the log data.</li>
    <li>The Errors which are segregated will be reviewed one by one</li>
    <li>These Errors will be reviewed by the  Gemini [Generative Language API]</li>
    <li>Gemini will categorize errors based on their severity, using a rating system from 1 to 5. A rating of 1 indicates the most serious issues.</li>
    <li>Gemini will suggest a comprehensive plan of action for troubleshooting errors.</li>
</ul>
